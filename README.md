## Description

The Clean Architecture, popularized by [Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), emphasizes several foundational principles:

1. **Framework Independence**: The system isn't reliant on external libraries or frameworks.
2. **Testability**: Business rules can be validated without any external elements.
3. **UI Independence**: Switching out the user interface won't affect the underlying system.
4. **Database Independence**: The system's business logic isn't tied to a specific database.
5. **Independence from External Agencies**: The business logic remains agnostic of external integrations.

### ✨ Additional Features and Patterns in This Project

This project not only adheres to Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles but also incorporates modern adaptations and extended features to meet contemporary development needs:

- **GraphQL vs REST**:<br>The `controllers` module contains two API interfaces. `graphql` provides for a robust GraphQL API, while `rest` focuses on RESTful API routes and controls.
- **RelationalDB vs NoSQL**:<br>The `repositories` module supports both relational databases (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases, including document-oriented stores (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB) and key-value stores (e.g., Redis, Memcached).

Apart from following Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture, this project also incorporates:

- **Repository Pattern**:<br>An abstraction that simplifies the decoupling of the model layer from data storage, thereby promoting flexibility and maintainability in the codebase. [^1]
- **Unit of Work Pattern**:<br>This pattern ensures that all operations within a single transaction are completed successfully, or none are completed at all. [^2]
- **Dependency Injection Pattern**:<br>Helps in reducing direct dependencies between codes, increasing the testability and flexibility of modules. [^3]
- **Asynchronous SQLalchemy**:<br>By utilizing the asynchronous capabilities of SQLAlchemy 2.0, database operations are optimized for performance and efficiently handle multitasking. [^4]

### 🧱 Project Structure Overview & Clean Architecture Mapping

> 📌 **Note**: While this project uses `controllers` for the external interface layer, teams may prefer alternatives like `handlers` (event-driven), `endpoints` (API-focused), `routes` (Express.js style), `api` (simple), `interfaces` (DDD), `gateways` (microservices), or `entrypoints` (original Clean Architecture). Choose what best aligns with your team's vocabulary.

#### Clean Architecture Flow Diagram

The Clean Architecture Flow Diagram visualizes the layers of Clean Architecture and how they interact. It consists of two images and an ASCII flow for clarity:

## Getting Started

Here's everything you need to get this project running on your local machine for development and testing.

### 🐳 Database Setup

This application is designed to support multiple databases. Choose one of the following setups:

#### Default Configuration (In-Memory SQLite)

The application will default to using an **In-Memory SQLite** database if no `DATABASE_URI` is specified.

#### Diverse Databases with Docker-Compose

For utilizing other databases, Docker Compose can be employed:

```sh
$ docker compose down --remove-orphans -v
$ docker compose up dockerize
```

### 🚀 Launching the Application

1. If employing a specific database, ensure the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable is set appropriately.
2. Proceed to initiate the application.

<a id="supported-database-uris"></a>

> **Supported Database URIs:**:
>
> - `sqlite+aiosqlite:///<dbname>.db` (SQLite)
> - `sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` (In-Memory SQLite)
> - `mysql+asyncmy://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>` (MySQL)
> - `postgresql+asyncpg://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>` (PostgreSQL)
> - `mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>` (MongoDB)
> - `redis://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>` (Redis)
>
> 📌 **Note**: If encountering issues with database initialization, consider appending **`reinitialize=true`** to the `DATABASE_URI` for reconfiguration, e.g., `sqlite+aiosqlite:///sqlite.db?reinitialize=true`.

#### Using Docker Compose:

To run the application inside a Docker container:

```sh
$ DATABASE_URI=<database-uri> docker compose up app
```

#### Using Make (with Poetry):

1. Ensure Python (version 3.11 or higher) and Poetry (version 2.1.x) are installed.

2. Configure your environment: [^6]

   ```sh
   $ poetry env use python3.11
   $ poetry shell
   $ poetry install
   ```

3. Launch the application:
   ```sh
   $ DATABASE_URI=<database-uri> make up
   ```

After setup, access the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

### 🧪 Testing the Application

#### Single Database Testing:

To conduct tests against a single database, specify its URI by configuring the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable:

```sh
$ DATABASE_URI=<database-uri> pytest
```

> For the list of supported database URIs, please refer to the [**Supported Database URIs**](#supported-database-uris)
>
> 📌 **Note**: For testing, it's recommended to use a different `dbname`, preferably with a "\_test" suffix (e.g., "mydatabase_test"). This ensures your tests don't interfere with your main application data.

#### Multi-Database Testing and Code Coverage: [^5]

To validate your application across various databases like In-Memory SQLite, SQLite, MySQL, Postgres and MongoDB, you'll utilize the tool called `bats`.

1. Installing `bats`

   **-** On macOS: use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

   ```sh
   $ brew install bats
   ```

   **-** On Linux: compile from the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core)

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
   $ cd bats-core
   $ ./install.sh /usr/local
   ```

2. Running Multi-DB tests and generating a test coverage report.

   ```shell
   $ make test
   api_db_test.bats
    ✓ Test using in-memory SQLite [9671]
    ✓ Test using MySQL [10551]
    ✓ Test using PostgreSQL [9104]
    ✓ Test using MongoDB [10780]
    ✓ Test using Redis [8422]
