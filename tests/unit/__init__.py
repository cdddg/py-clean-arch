"""
Unit Testing for the Application.

This module contains the unit tests for individual components and modules within the application. The tests here aim to ensure that each piece of functionality behaves as expected when tested in isolation from other components.

Key Characteristics:
    - Isolation: Each unit test focuses on a single component without relying on its external dependencies.
    - Mocking: Any external dependencies, such as databases or third-party services, are often 'mocked' or 'stubbed' out, allowing the test to focus purely on the logic of the unit under test.
    - Coverage: The goal is to cover every possible code path, function, and method, ensuring that each line of code gets tested for its intended behavior.

Centralized Testing Considerations:
    - Consolidation: Due to the configurations set in `pytest`'s `conftest.py`, all tests have been centralized within the `tests` directory. This approach allows for shared fixtures, settings, and other testing utilities, ensuring a consistent testing environment across different test types.
    - Organization: Within the `tests` directory, tests are further categorized into 'unit' and 'integration' based on their scope and the parts of the application they interact with. This structure makes it easier to run specific tests and understand the coverage of different parts of the application.

Remember that while unit tests are essential for ensuring the functionality of individual components, integration tests are crucial to ensure these units work well when integrated.
