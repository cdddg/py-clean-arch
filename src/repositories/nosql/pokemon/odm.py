File Description:
    This file defines the object-document mapping (ODM) for MongoDB for Pokemon entities, but it hasn't been implemented yet.
    The project is currently researching [Beanie](https://beanie-odm.dev/), an asynchronous Python ODM for MongoDB, to explore its potential usage.

The anticipated document structure is as follows:
    +-------------------------------------------+
    | Pokemon                                   |
    +-------------------------------------------+
    | no: ObjectId                              |  # Unique identifier for the Pokemon
    | name: String                              |  # Name of the Pokemon
    | types: List[String]                       |  # List of types associated with the Pokemon
    | previous_evolutions: List[ObjectId]       |  # List of ObjectIds pointing to previous evolutionary forms of the Pokemon
    | next_evolutions: List[ObjectId]           |  # List of ObjectIds pointing to subsequent evolutionary forms of the Pokemon
    +-------------------------------------------+
