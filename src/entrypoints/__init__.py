"""
Entrypoints Package.

This package contains entrypoints exposing external interfaces to the application,
such as REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and potentially other communication protocols
(gRPC, RPC, etc.).

Original intent of naming 'entrypoints':
- Clearly indicate that this package acts as a unified access point for different
  external communication channels.

Considerations:
- The term 'entrypoint' might potentially cause confusion with Docker's `ENTRYPOINT`.
- If this naming creates ambiguity or confusion within your context, consider renaming
  this package to more intuitive alternatives like `apis` or `gateways` or ... .
