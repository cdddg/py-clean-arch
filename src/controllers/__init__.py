Controllers Package.

This package contains controllers exposing external interfaces to the application,
such as REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, and potentially other communication protocols
(gRPC, RPC, etc.).

Controllers handle:
- HTTP request routing and response formatting
- Input validation and data transformation
- Coordination between use cases and external interfaces
- Exception handling for API endpoints
